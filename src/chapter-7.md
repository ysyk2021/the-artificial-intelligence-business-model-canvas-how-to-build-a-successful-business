The legal framework surrounding AI business models can be complex and varied, depending on the location and industry in which the business operates. It is important for organizations to be aware of relevant laws and regulations and ensure they are in compliance. Key legal considerations may include:

* Intellectual property rights
* Liability and responsibility for AI-generated outcomes
