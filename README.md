Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the way we live and work, and its impact on business is no exception. From automating routine tasks to creating new opportunities for innovation and growth, AI is transforming businesses across industries.

However, building a successful business using intelligent technologies requires more than just technical expertise. It also requires a solid understanding of the business model canvas, which is a framework used to develop and analyze business models.

In this book, we will explore the artificial intelligence business model canvas, which is a modified version of the traditional business model canvas specifically tailored to businesses that incorporate AI technologies. We will provide an overview of each component of the canvas and explain how they apply to AI-based businesses.

Whether you're an entrepreneur looking to start an AI-based business or a business leader seeking to incorporate AI into your existing operations, this book will provide you with the tools and knowledge you need to succeed. By the end of this book, you will have a clear understanding of how to build a successful business using intelligent technologies, and be equipped with the skills and strategies needed to thrive in the rapidly evolving world of AI.
